This is my CS50 project submission which uses Google Sheets as a database, and Clasp and Parcel for deploying modern Javascript to Google's Apps Script (GAS) projects V8 engine. 

### Get Started

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, install Clasp globally `npm install @google/clasp -g` and if prompted for a dependency, inquirer@^6.0.0,  run `npm install inquirer@^6.0.0 -g`. 

If you are using Codespaces, Log in to clasp `clasp login --no-localhost`, othewise you can use `clasp login` at the terminal.

Delete the existing .clasp.json file and then create your starter web app: `clasp create --type webapp  --title "Your Title" --rootDir ./appsscript`

Next install Parcel, Parcel Bundler and the plugin to inline: `npm install --global parcel parcel-bundler parcel-plugin-inliner`.

### Build and Deploy

Once it is setup, run your build with `npx parcel build client/index.html --no-minify --no-source-maps --no-cache`.  I used the live server extension to test if the styling and javascript worked as expected. 

To push your deploy, use the command `npm run bld`

Before you can view your webapp, you need an  initial deploy. One way is to run `clasp deploy --description "Initial Deploy"`, or you can change the description to anything you see fit.  You can also do this from the Apps Script dashboard, `clasp open` will get you to your project on the dashboard and from there you can use the menu options.

### Includes

Starter template for [Bootstrap 5](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/) with the sticky footer.  Instructions for importing it as a [Parcel Recipe](https://parceljs.org/recipes.html).

A .devcontainer for Node and Javascript Projects for [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces).
